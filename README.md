# Scanned Gaskets
Repo for scanned and vectorized gaskets for my many projects

These files can be used for cutting out on a cricut machine or used to import into a STL maker like tinkercad

*Note* Because Illistrator doesnt support 96 DPI SVG's and only uses 72 you need to multiply SVG's by 1.33 before cutting/printing
